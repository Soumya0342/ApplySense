Privacy Policy for ApplySense

ApplySense is a Chrome extension designed to help users avoid duplicate job applications on LinkedIn.

Data Collection and Usage

No External Sharing
ApplySense does not send any data to external servers. No third-party services, analytics tools, advertising networks, or tracking mechanisms are used.

No Personal Identification
ApplySense does not collect names, email addresses, passwords, authentication credentials, financial information, or location data.

Local Storage Only
All data stored by ApplySense remains local to the user’s browser and can be removed at any time by uninstalling the extension or clearing browser storage.
